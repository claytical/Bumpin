To include custom samples, I've tried to streamline the process a little, though some restrictions apply:

1: new instruments must be 36 notes long (3 octaves) starting on C and ascending 3 octaves (finishing on a B 36 notes higher).

2: files must be named 1.mp3, 2.mp3 et cetera, through 36.mp3.

3: If you haven't already, ensure that you've moved/ merged the streaming assets folder from MusicGenerator/ to your main Assets directory (Application.datapath).

4:Place these 36 files inside a folder with your instrument name and place this folder in /MusicGenerator/Assets/Resources/Music/  (take care it doesn't conflict with an existing instrument in streaming assets otherwise it will overwrite it)

5: Repeat for additional instruments.

6: Move the folder /MusicGenerator/Editor to your main Application.Database path (the main /Assets/ folder of your project). Additionally, make sure you've already moved the Streaming assets folder into the main Application.Database path.

7: new Unity menu options should appear at the top of unity under Assets:

BuildAndCleanAllMusicAssets  : One button does all. Will build new asset bundles for these instruments and place in StreamingAssets/MusicGenerator/ for linux, mac, and windows, and clean up any files used in the creation process.

If you want to build for a single platform, you need to run:
 Menu>Assets>"Build PrefabsFromPaths", 
 then:
 "Build Linux Assets" (for example), 
 then:
 "Clean Up Music Prefabs". 
 in order to build the prefab, save it to an asset bundle, then clean up the temporary prefabs that were created.

8: In your MusicGenerator object in your scene hierarchy, under mBaseInstrumentPaths, add the name of the instrument folders you added.

9: when creating instruments, the generator supports mixed instruments, where several versions of the notes are imported, and when playing, randomly chooses among them. This helps avoid a mechanical feeling if the same note is repeatedly played (for instance, the ViolinShortMix instrument included in the asset has two samples included. One has short and choppy sounding notes, the other short but smooth notes and when it plays, any given note is random between them. Compare this instrument against the normal ViolinShort instrument to see the difference).

To import a mixed instrument you'll want each instrument's folder name to include a "_1", "_2", "_3" etc.
For example the violinShortMix folder structure before importing looked like
ViolinShortMix_1
ViolinShortMix_2
ViolinShortMix_3

Do not nest the files under a parent instrument directory, they should be located as:
MusicGenerator/Assets/Resources/Music/ViolinShort_1,
MusicGenerator/Assets/Resources/Music/ViolinShort_2, 
etc.

its name in the MusicGenerator's mBaseInstrumentsPath remains simply "ViolinShortMix" and the generator will detect the variations. 

To import percussion or sfx (things with a single note), prefix the name with "P_"  i.e. "P_Snare".  The same rules for variation apply (i.e. P_Snare_1, P_Snare_2 if you have multiples).
